### About me

My name is Angel, and I am a software engineer specializing in frontend applications. I started web development in 2007 and acquired a strong knowledge and expertise in this field over time.

Generally speaking, I love working and sharing on topics related to software architecture and software quality. I like to see myself as a passionate developer, an Open Source enthusiast and an eternal learner.

I have experience in various programming languages â€‹â€‹and various technologies, which I have matured over the years. I am currently a senior developer at Dofleini software.
